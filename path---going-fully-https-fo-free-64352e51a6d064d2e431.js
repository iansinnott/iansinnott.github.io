I just discovered something super cool which is currently letting my host my blog, a <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> site, using SSL.</p>\n<h2 id="all-the-ssl-fo-free-using-cloudflare"><a href="#all-the-ssl-fo-free-using-cloudflare" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>All the SSL fo\' free using CloudFlare</h2>\n<p>It turns out if you use <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">CloudFlare</a> for DNS on your domain you can also get SSL completely for free.</p>\n<p><img src="//dropsinn.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen%20Shot%202016-04-29%20at%2012.43.40%20PM.png" alt="CloudFlare Free Cert"></p>\n<p>The setup is pretty simple as well. CloudFlare has the excellent feature that they will scan your domain and migrate most of the DNS settings for you. So all I ended up having to do to get blog.iansinnott.com running over HTTPS was to move my DNS to CloudFlare. The DNS propagation took overnight, but the time I had to personally spend was less than 30 minutes.</p>\n<p>Again, this is completely free, which is why I\'m happy to write about CloudFlare and give them what amounts to free advertising. I\'m guessing they make their money with enterprise clients as opposed to individuals. Either way, I\'ve found this to be an excellent free service and I\'m happy to now have my GitHub Pages site running over SSL for free.</p>',frontmatter:{created:"2016-04-29T07:00:00.000Z",title:"Going fully HTTPS (SSL) fo' free"}}},pathContext:{id:"/Users/jandrix/dev/sites/blog.iansinnott.com/content/_posts/2016-04-29-going-fully-https-fo-free.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",next:{frontmatter:{title:"The Importance of Community",created:"2016-04-29T07:00:00.000Z"},slug:"the-importance-of-community"},prev:{frontmatter:{title:"Testing Webpack Plugins",created:"2016-05-11T07:00:00.000Z"},slug:"testing-webpack-plugins"}}}}});
