As such, I really wanted to start contributing back to this amazing community that has helped nurture my own development.</p>\\n<!-- more -->\\n<p>I learned React and the surrounding ecosystem on my own and I know how daunting it can be.

And while you probably should know what all these things are after being part of the community for a while it can be very daunting when it's all new.</p>\\n<p>So in creating this workshop I wanted to utilize all the knowledge I've accumulated over the past year while learning React to help speed the process for others.

If you didn't know he teaches React for a living and has a lot of good advice when it comes to teaching it. I asked him about his teaching methods and he reminded me that in a real world scenario students will almost never be facing an empty fileâ€”they will instead be editing existing code.</p>\\n<p>This was something of a revelation for me. It makes perfect sense that at most companies you will be editing â€“ not creating â€“ new code, but it never crossed my mind. I work at a startup and have build all of my company's projects from scratch... but that's unusual.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"provide-scrum-like-direction-during-exercises\\\"><a href=\\\"#provide-scrum-like-direction-during-exercises\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Provide Scrum-like direction during exercises</h3>\\n<p>This ties into the point above about not starting from scratch. Students would have benefited from more organized exercises with action lists that they could follow to completion. Instead I left it open ended and showed students the final app before asking them to build it from scratch.</p>\\n<p>Next time I will provide more structure. Since many of the students at the workshop already work at companies they would likely be used to a Scrum-like project structure with minimal user stories and such.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"next-steps\\\"><a href=\\\"#next-steps\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Next Steps</h2>\\n<p>My takeaways from this experience were:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Putting on a workshop can be a ton of fun</li>\\n<li>There's a serious market for learning React, especially here in SF</li>\\n<li>I really enjoyed speaking and am going to pursue it further</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>To that last point, I will be speaking at my first conference in a week about <a href=\\\"http://fitc.ca/presentation/building-static-sites-with-react/\\\">building static sites with React</a>.</p>\\n<p>With all the current hype over React and React Native it really feels like React is eating the world.

It was hugely fun to stand at the front of the class and speak about a technology I'm passionate about, and now I want to do more of it.</p>\\n<p>Moving forward I'm going to pursue more speaking opportunities, including at conferences and tech schools here in SF. The goal will continue to be to provide as much value as possible to the students and/or audience members.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"room-for-improvement\\\"><a href=\\\"#room-for-improvement\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Room for improvement</h2>\\n<p>The workshop went well, but it certainly wasn't perfect.

If you didn't know he teaches React for a living and has a lot of good advice when it comes to teaching it. I asked him about his teaching methods and he reminded me that in a real world scenario students will almost never be facing an empty fileâ€”they will instead be editing existing code.</p>\\n<p>This was something of a revelation for me. It makes perfect sense that at most companies you will be editing â€“ not creating â€“ new code, but it never crossed my mind. I work at a startup and have build all of my company's projects from scratch... but that's unusual.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"provide-scrum-like-direction-during-exercises\\\"><a href=\\\"#provide-scrum-like-direction-during-exercises\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Provide Scrum-like direction during exercises</h3>\\n<p>This ties into the point above about not starting from scratch. Students would have benefited from more organized exercises with action lists that they could follow to completion. Instead I left it open ended and showed students the final app before asking them to build it from scratch.</p>\\n<p>Next time I will provide more structure. Since many of the students at the workshop already work at companies they would likely be used to a Scrum-like project structure with minimal user stories and such.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"next-steps\\\"><a href=\\\"#next-steps\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Next Steps</h2>\\n<p>My takeaways from this experience were:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Putting on a workshop can be a ton of fun</li>\\n<li>There's a serious market for learning React, especially here in SF</li>\\n<li>I really enjoyed speaking and am going to pursue it further</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>To that last point, I will be speaking at my first conference in a week about <a href=\\\"http://fitc.ca/presentation/building-static-sites-with-react/\\\">building static sites with React</a>.</p>\\n<p>With all the current hype over React and React Native it really feels like React is eating the world.
