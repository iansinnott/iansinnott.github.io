I grew up in tiny town called Point Arena, about four hours north of the Bay Area. Despite this, I never actually spent any significant time in San Francisco, so I was very excited to have the chance to live here for a month, especially after spending two years abroad. Better yet, the day I landed was my birthday :+1:</p>\n<h3>The Vibe is right...</h3>\n<p>As soon as I had spend 24 hours in the city, I could see myself living here. I like to walk and take public transportation, so I don&#39;t generally speak very highly of American cities. SF has that. Nightlife that&#39;s not strictly limited to weekends is also a plus, and that also seems to be a thing here. But what I have thus far enjoyed most about this city, is the mentality.</p>\n<p>People everywhere here are trying to start a company, or get recruited by their favorite company, or just build something cool in their spare time. Everyone seems to be <span class=\"italic\">doing</span> something, and that something is usually very cool or at least interesting to hear about. I can see why many people say this place is a bubble, but it&#39;s not a bad bubble to find yourself in.</p>\n<h3>... but how does anyone get anything done?</h3>\n<p>This city is so good, and I&#39;ve been having so much fun that I have gotten much less done than I did in Delhi, where I spent most of the day in an office.</p>\n<p>If I had to summarize my time here so far, I would simply say this city is too much fun to get much done. But that&#39;s OK, after I leave here I&#39;m planning a trip to Washington before heading back to my favorite city: <span class=\"bold\">Taipei</span> :)</p>","properties":{"tags":"life,travel","created":"2014-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","title":"A Month In San Francisco","disqusId":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"6498117f-6514-5667-a4de-675781b15bbc","prev":{"id":"c3493f9d-a4e4-58d8-a097-35c81a71ea5c","slug":"using-emoji-in-excerpts-on-github-pages","properties":{"title":"Using Emoji in Excerpts on GitHub Pages","created":"2014-07-08T00:00:00.000Z"}}}}}
