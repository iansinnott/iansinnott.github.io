It took about two hours to get most things reinstalled and running again, and after the fact I was very happy with the results. My computer is now fresh again, the downloads folder doesn&#39;t have 1000 items in it and I have over 100GB of free space (up from ~5GB before)! All in all a very quick and painless experience... until this week.</p>\n<h2>Know what to migrate</h2>\n<p>It&#39;s tough to keep track of everything on your system that&#39;s vital to your day-to-day workflow. The toughest are the things that aren&#39;t needed day-to-day, but which become vital the second you try do something that depends on them. In my case this was building an android app for distribution.</p>\n<p>To distribute an app on the Google Play Store you need to create a Java Keystore to sign your app with. This file is monumentally important if you&#39;re an app developer, because without it you cannot update your app. This week I had to update an app on Google Play and figured out how important that file was.</p>\n<h2>Time Machine to the rescue</h2>\n<p>Luckily, I did make sure to back up my entire system before reinstalling OSX, so I knew I must have my Java Keystore saved somewhere. I just had to find it. This was actually surprisingly fast as I had initially stored it under a folder named <code >keystore</code>. Simple enough. I hit restore in Time Machine and done, it was on my system.</p>\n<p>Excellent, now I just need to sign my Android APK and I would be good to go. This particular project is built with Cordova, so the easiest way I&#39;ve found to do this is to specify an <code >ant.properties</code> file under <code >platforms/android</code>. There&#39;s a great, concise <a href=\"http://ilee.co.uk/Sign%E2%B8%BBReleases%E2%B8%BBwith%E2%B8%BBCordova%E2%B8%BBAndroid/\">article on this with full instructions</a>.</p>\n<p>Great, now to just run the command...</p>\n<pre>$ cordova build android --release\n\n...\n\n-release-prompt-for-password:\n[input] Please enter keystore password</pre>\n<p>... shit. Did not remember my keystore required a password.</p>\n<p>At point I ended up trying a few common passwords all of which failed, but I did ultimately figure it out. I wrote a quick Ruby script to run through a list of about 20 potential passwords and one of them did turn out to be the right one. So in the end not a terrible experience, just a strong reminder that backing up everything is always a good idea, and backing up the keys to your apps is paramount.</p>","properties":{"tags":null,"created":"2014-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Time Machine to the Rescue","disqusId":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"48321965-25d8-598c-94de-1391636cb0c9","prev":{"id":"a06bc040-a92e-56a2-a02f-15bf8cb76b42","slug":"business","properties":{"title":"Business","created":"2014-10-01T00:00:00.000Z"}}}}}
