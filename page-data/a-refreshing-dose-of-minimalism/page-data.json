It&#39;s a blog, so I knew I wouldn&#39;t need too much JS. I started with a blank file and started coding.</p>\n<p>Once I was satisfied with the event handling logic I had set up I sat back and reviewed my work. 44 lines including a few comments and zero dependencies. Not too bad. The web has come a long way. CSS was able to take care of a lot of the interactions and animations. But I still wanted to do better.</p>\n<p>It occurred to me that I could actually use the <code >:hover</code> state to accomplish all of my open/close menu interactions. Done! A few more lines eliminated. But I still had the <code >focus</code> event handler I was using to select all text in a text box whenever a user put their cursor inside it. I don&#39;t think CSS can do that... so I did end up using JS for this. I took it out of my script file and in-lined it on the input directly.</p>\n<p>That was the last event I was handling so now I scrapped my whole JS file with its event logic. Wow! No external JS file. How novel... ðŸ˜•.</p>\n<p>All in all here is the extent of the JS I wrote for the site:</p>\n<pre>this.setSelectionRange(0, this.value.length);</pre>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">Aside:</span> I&#39;m certainly not against large web appsâ€”on the contrary, I love them. But for this particular project I chose to revel in the minimalism of leveraging CSS to handle almost all of my site interactions.</p>","properties":{"tags":"javascript","created":"2016-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","title":"A refreshing dose of minimalism","disqusId":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"b25e2868-810d-5ac0-bc72-ee6972003093","prev":{"id":"4a88ee86-bfe9-5560-9546-81bab3bd6620","slug":"getting-started-with-flow-and-webpack","properties":{"title":"Getting Started with Flow and Webpack","created":"2016-06-11T00:00:00.000Z"}}}}}
