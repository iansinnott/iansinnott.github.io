Since docker is running within boot2docker containers will be exposed via ports on the boot2docker IP.</p>\n<p>For example, if running <code >docker ps</code> tells you your app is exposing port 80 on some high-numbered port on the local host, it is actually exposed via boot2dockers IP:</p>\n<pre>$ docker ps\nCONTAINER ID    IMAGE NAMES      PORTS\n6751b94bb5c0    ubuntu:latest    0.0.0.0:49154-&gt;80/tcp</pre>\n<p>Going to <code >0.0.0.0:49154</code> in your browser won&#39;t work. You need to replace <code >0.0.0.0</code> with boot2docker&#39;s IP address. To find it, run:</p>\n<pre>$ boot2docker ip\n\nThe VM&#39;s Host only interface IP address is: 192.168.55.555</pre>\n<p>Putting that into the browser will along with the correct port will give you <code >192.168.55.555:49154</code> and you will be able to access your web app as expected.</p>\n<p>This may all be very simple for anyone familiar with networking, but it took me a good amount of time to figure this out with no error message. I guess you should just run Docker on Linux ðŸ˜‰</p>\n<p>Although not entirely related, I wrote a gist to automatically export boot2docker&#39;s IP address into an environment variable whenever it is set:</p>\n<p>{% gist iansinnott/0a0c212260386bdbfafb %}</p>","properties":{"tags":"ops,docker","created":"2014-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Using Docker on a Mac with Boot2Docker","disqusId":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a47ce774-07eb-56fa-907a-91f9928e0738","prev":{"id":"99e80c50-d23c-5291-a348-c5ea09646250","slug":"programmer-maker-or-both","properties":{"title":"Programmer, Maker or Both?","created":"2014-09-24T00:00:00.000Z"}}}}}
