It&#39;s been a bit of a long time coming, but my new website is finally live online. If you&#39;re interested you can check it out at my home page here: <a href=\"http://iansinnott.com\">iansinnott.com</a>.</p>\n<h2>So what?</h2>\n<p>The big reason I&#39;m super excited about this iteration of my home site is that it was designed entirely from scratch. The previous iterations of my site were all influenced heavily by designer friends of mine, but this latest work is my own. So you&#39;ll have to excuse me if I&#39;m a little more excited than usual about launching a new site.</p>\n<h2>Not quite done</h2>\n<p>All that being said, there is still work to be done. The new site isn&#39;t entirely consistent with this blog. It&#39;s not a very big deal, but I really like consistency so updating this site to match the new visual style is now on my to-do list. The new site is also thoroughly untested, so if you stumble upon a part of it that seems broken please don&#39;t hesitate to <a href=\"http://iansinnott.com/contact\">get in touch</a> and let me know.</p>","properties":{"tags":null,"created":"2015-01-08T00:00:00.000Z","title":"New Site Is Live","disqusId":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"577d6e29-8c6a-51e6-a1be-25bcc76f7762","prev":{"id":"71c75108-ee21-5dcd-bfd4-a07c331b958b","slug":"new-site-in-the-works","properties":{"title":"New Site in the Works","created":"2014-12-13T00:00:00.000Z"}}}}}
