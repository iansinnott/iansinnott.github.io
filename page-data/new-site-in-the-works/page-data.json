Well, I&#39;m excited to say it&#39;s coming along quite nicely. Here is a preview of the new look:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://dropsinn.s3.amazonaws.com/website-mockup-banner-min.jpg?table=block&id=\" alt=\"New website mockup\"/><figcaption>New website mockup</figcaption></figure>\n<p>If you have any feedback I&#39;d love to hear it. Feel free to comment bellow.</p>\n<h2>Motivation</h2>\n<p>My motivation for redesigning the site pretty simple: The site hasn&#39;t changed in over <span class=\"italic\">two years</span>. Under &quot;Work&quot;, the old site lists a number of personal projects that donâ€™t even exist anymore. The &quot;Skills&quot; section is likewise outdated, listing PHP, MySQL and Photoshop. These days those have all been replaced by Node.js/Ruby, MongoDB and Sketch respectively.</p>\n<p>If I&#39;m being honest with myself I don&#39;t think the old site is <span class=\"italic\">that</span> bad, but it&#39;s time for a change. I&#39;ll be launching sometime before Christmas. ðŸ˜Ž</p>","properties":{"tags":null,"created":"2014-12-13T00:00:00.000Z","title":"New Site in the Works","disqusId":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"71c75108-ee21-5dcd-bfd4-a07c331b958b","prev":{"id":"f7e102fd-f393-535a-a2ad-ae957dc8b6a8","slug":"a-site-a-day","properties":{"title":"A Site a Day","created":"2014-12-08T00:00:00.000Z"}}}}}
