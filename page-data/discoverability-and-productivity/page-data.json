Things like:</p>\n<ul><li>Authentication and authorization with third-party APIs</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Scheduling (cron) </li></ul>\n<ul><li>Server side functions without a server</li></ul>\n<h3>An Example: CRON</h3>\n<ul><li>Do I use cron often enough to learn the commands? at present the answer is a clear no. But is cron occasionally useful? Hell yes. When it&#39;s useful it&#39;s extremely useful, which is to say it&#39;s straight up super useful I just don&#39;t need it that often.</li></ul>\n<h3>An example: Dev ops related tasks</h3>\n<ul><li>Do I manage infrastructure often enough to learn all the <code >gcloud</code> commands? No. However, when I need some infrastructure a good UI is very much appreciated. Also, I <span class=\"italic\">do</span> manage infrastructure, just not very often. So I don&#39;t have much incentive to become a dev ops wizard and yet I still need to do the task sometimes.</li></ul>\n<h1>Exploring the options</h1>\n<p>Let&#39;s look at some of whats available in the wild right now</p>\n\n<div class=\"toggle\"><input id=toggle-5694804564349207 type=\"checkbox\" /><label for=toggle-5694804564349207 class=\"toggle-title\">Zapier (the expensive one)</label><div class=\"toggle-body\"><ul><li>They really tend towards NoCode as opposed to LowCode, which means their UI is quite advanced but if you are inclined to actually write some code you might find yourself meandering through the UI for minutes on end just to write the equivalent of a simple function. I&#39;m thinking specifically of logic statements, filtering and data mapping.</li></ul><ul><li>Their integrations <span class=\"italic\">really work</span> which is impressive. It&#39;s no mean feat to support ever-changing APIs.</li></ul></div></div>\n<div class=\"toggle\"><input id=toggle-211521614207961 type=\"checkbox\" /><label for=toggle-211521614207961 class=\"toggle-title\">Integromat</label><div class=\"toggle-body\"><ul><li>Not much else to say about them since I just started playing with the service, but I&#39;m a fan.</li></ul></div></div>\n<div class=\"toggle\"><input id=toggle-9512555992297409 type=\"checkbox\" /><label for=toggle-9512555992297409 class=\"toggle-title\"><a href=\"https://n8n.io/integrations\">n8n</a></label><div class=\"toggle-body\"><ul><li>Free to use but not for commercial interests. Still, may well work for personal automation. The reason this is more worrying is that if it doesn&#39;t work out as a business it may completely lose traction.</li></ul><ul><li>Here&#39;s the repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n\">https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n</a></li></ul></div></div>\n<div class=\"toggle\"><input id=toggle-019779771892104003 type=\"checkbox\" /><label for=toggle-019779771892104003 class=\"toggle-title\">IFTTT</label><div class=\"toggle-body\"><ul><li>Abysmal UX, although it is possible to get things done. It&#39;s a non-trivial product so I know some people put a lot of time and effort into it. This is certainly not a critique of those people, but I feel I should not pull any punches here. I gave up on using IFTTT <span class=\"italic\">multiple times</span> before ever getting it to do anything meaningful because I couldn&#39;t figure out how to create a new workflow. Hard to describe in words, but I found myself expecting a &quot;create new&quot; button <span class=\"italic\">so much</span> that I didn&#39;t even go looking in other parts of the UI for it. I thought it was impossible to do anything other than use premade workflows.<figure><img src=\"https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fdd7e3145-7f69-4804-916c-53031f987d64%2F2020-04-18_at_2.24_PM.png\" alt=\"The actual area to \"Create\" a new workflow is in the profile dropdown menu... why? \"/><figcaption>The actual area to &quot;Create&quot; a new workflow is in the profile dropdown menu... why? </figcaption></figure></li></ul></div></div>\n<div class=\"toggle\"><input id=toggle-05678367247322713 type=\"checkbox\" /><label for=toggle-05678367247322713 class=\"toggle-title\">OneGraph</label><div class=\"toggle-body\"><ul><li>Currently certain endpoints (like YouTube) are pretty limited, but they&#39;re actively working on it. </li></ul></div></div>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://nodered.org/\">Node-red</a><ul><li>I saved this for last since it&#39;s probably the most promising of the self-hosted solutions. Looks very powerful and fairly intuitive to use. More importantly it looks <span class=\"italic\">extensible</span> and community supported.</li></ul><ul><li>What&#39;s troubling is that I&#39;m not sure why it exists. It seems to be an IBM project, but why? If it remains free and open source, what&#39;s the incentive for IBM? They do offer to set it up quickly for you in their cloud infrastructure, but that doesn&#39;t seem like a big enough lift to put them on a competitive footing with AWS or GCP.</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been playing around with Node-red recently and so far it seems like it might just hit the sweet spot of not overemphasizing &quot;No code&quot; while still providing useful UI abstractions over many common functions.</p>\n<h1>A middle ground</h1>\n<p>My thinking has gravitated to this idea, that there must be a middle ground where you know in your soul and muscle memory that which is relevant most often (this makes you productive) and for all the rest you have a discoverable UI that let&#39;s you be productive enough given how little you use the service or function.</p>\n<p>The tricky part is it&#39;s going to be different for everyone. For some, the hyper specific <code >gcloud</code> or <code >aws</code> commands are extremely relevant and it pays to know them and use them. For others, maybe the <span class=\"italic\">No</span>Code approach is good enough and nothing specific enough to warrant real code is ever needed.</p>\n<p>I of course am somewhere in the middle. My thesis is this:</p>\n<div class=\"callout\">LowCode solutions could prove to be the perfect medium to capture all the marginal use cases. All the use cases where it&#39;s not worth it to learn the thing well, but prior to LowCode learning it well was the only option.</div>\n","properties":{"tags":"productivity","created":"2020-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Discoverability and Productivity","disqusId":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"7903355b-f73d-507c-b769-fa0c21aca871","prev":{"id":"236439d9-f775-5b9d-b94f-ef986b44ad23","slug":"searching-vs-filtering","properties":{"title":"Searching vs Filtering","created":"2020-04-14T00:00:00.000Z"}}}}}
