Creating layout from scratch is perfectly doable but also perfectly tedious. I have yet to meet a developer who enjoys that aspect of it. We like the stages where we get to build shiny things on a site. So here is what I got into today:</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://cssgrid.net/\">The 1140 Grid System</a></li></ul>\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://imperavi.com/kube/\">Kube</a></li></ul>\n<p>The first one has been around for quite some time. The original developer actually stopped updating it because after creating it he learned so much that it lost it&#39;s use. That&#39;s awesome, but for a ton of developers it&#39;s still a great tool. I would say it&#39;s best feature is simplicity. It&#39;s not the most robust framework but if you want something really light and simple to set up try it out.</p>\n<p>The second, Kube, is another fully responsive grid system. I didn&#39;t really look into Kube&#39;s layout features because I was already using 1140, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s good. I really like Kube&#39;s design elements that make it super simple to add very sophisticated styling to elements in a few seconds. The one drawback to me was that it is built with LESS instead of Sass. I actually run into this fairly often. It seems as though the majority of the well known frameworks are built with LESS.</p>\n<p>So, instead of sit around and pout I converted a number of Kube&#39;s features into Sass. Now I&#39;m developing with a mix of these two grid systems. Kube mainly for UI elements and 1140 for layout. I&#39;m considering actually rolling these together into something usable and Sass based (finally) so that anyone else can enjoy it without switching to LESS. I&#39;ll post an update with that is finished.</p>","properties":{"tags":"css","created":"2013-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","title":"The Wonders of CSS Frameworks","disqusId":"1070486878"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"371ac690-e8cd-50d0-b9c8-beccd9d7aa9a","prev":{"id":"fec4f71c-f1c3-55f1-a8f5-a7e69ff23ad6","slug":"wordpress-theming-from-scratch","properties":{"title":"WordPress Theming From Scratch","created":"2013-01-11T00:00:00.000Z"}}}}}
