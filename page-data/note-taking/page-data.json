I was surprised. I don&#39;t expect everyone to take notes, but this particular friend is also a member of the likes-to-study-things camp. If you study things you take notes, right? </p>\n<h1>The case for note taking</h1>\n<ul><li>You can refer to your notes later and jog your memory.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>You will retain more of what you study.</li></ul>\n<p>That&#39;s it. Two points. Want more detail? Here we go.</p>\n<h2>Refer back to past information</h2>\n<p>This one is pretty obvious so I&#39;ll just point out one particular nuance I&#39;ve found beneficialâ€”notes created by your past self are <span class=\"italic\">extremely</span> well tailored to your way of thinking.</p>\n<p>Reviewing old notes can be like having the worlds best tutor, because the author new your brain better than anyone else.</p>\n<p>Your own notes work much than reviewing whatever material helped you create your notes in the past.</p>\n<h2>Retain more information</h2>\n<p>This is the big on. The primary reason I advocate note taking. I myself don&#39;t go back and read past notes very often, but the fact that I took them adds to my retention of any topic.</p>\n<ul><li>Reading non-fiction? ðŸ‘‰Take some notes.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Learning a new subject? ðŸ‘‰Take some notes.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Just met a new person and want to remember what you talked about? ðŸ‘‰Take some notes.</li></ul>\n<p>If you don&#39;t believe me just try it for yourself. In some area you&#39;re currently studying try taking notes for a week. </p>\n<h1>A note taking workflow</h1>\n<p>So that covers the &quot;why,&quot; now let&#39;s get into &quot;how.&quot;</p>\n<div class=\"callout\">Disclaimer. There are a million note-taking apps for a reason. People work in different ways. The specifics here are all subjective.</div>\n<h2>The types of notes</h2>\n<ul><li>Reference material.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Spontaneous musings.</li></ul>\n<p>It&#39;s important to distinguish different types of note taking. In my life there are currently these two kinds.</p>\n<h3>Reference Material</h3>\n<p>This is classic note taking. You learn something and write something down about it.</p>\n<p>Reference material is anything you might want to reference in the future. Examples:</p>\n<ul><li>Quotes from books your reading</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Websites</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Momentous thoughts</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Business ideas</li></ul>\n<ul><li>etc</li></ul>\n<h3>Spontaneous Musings</h3>\n<p>These can be anything, but what separates spontaneous musings from reference material is that they aren&#39;t meant to be referenced. You write something down and forget about it. Maybe you review it, maybe you don&#39;t.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ll repeat that since &quot;musings&quot; might not be clear on its own: This type of note is <span class=\"bold\">not meant to be reviewed</span> later. It can be, but there&#39;s no expectation. </p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<ul><li>Journaling</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Thoughts on books or podcasts</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Rants<ul><li>This is an important one. Most likely no one wants to hear your rants, but dumping a rant into a note and forgetting about it can be therapeutic. </li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>Anything else</li></ul>\n<h3>Workflow</h3>\n<p>So how do I personally put this into practice? I use two apps:</p>\n<ul><li>Notion: For reference material.<ul><li>When studying something I take notes on it. Books, programming languages, business ideas, etc.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>Day One: For spontaneous musings.<ul><li>I really like this one. It supports ver long audio snippets which is extremely useful for note taking while walking. I listen to a lot of books / podcasts so this is super handy.</li></ul><ul><li>The journal functionality is good, although there are a million options for journaling. I just like their UI and feature set for my personal use case.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<h1>Fin</h1>\n<p>That&#39;s all.
