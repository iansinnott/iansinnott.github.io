Thinking about this day in particular made me want to write something.</p>\n<p>Today I have no special plans. What should I do for my 30th?</p>\n<h2><span class=\"bold\">üõ∏ Take a vacation?</span></h2>\n<p>This would be quite appealing, but not nearly as much so now that I&#39;m living in Taiwan. I&#39;m essentially where I want to be for now. I&#39;m not on a beach as I write this, so there&#39;s still plenty of room for vacationing, but the drive to immediately jump ship for somewhere more tropical or novel is simply not there. I&#39;m happy here.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"bold\">ü§ë Buy something?</span></h2>\n<p>Also plenty of options here. There are a bunch of material things I&#39;d like to have, but nothing pressing. Nothing I want so bad that I simply need to go out and get it immediately.</p>\n<p>The most important bits are all taken care of:</p>\n<ul><li>Comfortable place to live</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Access to delicious food</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Computer + phone (i.e. electronics to meet my needs)</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Gym membership</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Access to a social circle, events</li></ul>\n<p>All my basic needs are met so all the various things I might buy just don&#39;t feel pressing enough.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"bold\">ü•Ç Go out and party?</span></h2>\n<p>The classic! I have certainly done this one on many past birthdays and I&#39;m sure there will be many more nights of revelry in the future. There&#39;s just no need for a reason to revel‚Äîif I want to go out I will and tonight I don&#39;t feel the desire.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"bold\">üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è In closing</span></h2>\n<p>To be clear, I haven&#39;t decided that I&#39;m now too <span class=\"italic\">old</span>, too <span class=\"italic\">mature</span>, too <span class=\"italic\">whatever</span> for any of the above, I just don&#39;t feel the need to do something special as I once did.</p>\n<p>In a sense, everything feels to be on track, and that&#39;s the best birthday gift I could wish for.</p>","properties":{"tags":"personal","created":"2019-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","title":"On turning 30","disqusId":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"b5d91720-85c6-5b1e-a560-5010021bfa15","prev":{"id":"8ec90c86-c7b6-5e17-8d25-526457725ab4","slug":"migrating-my-blog-to-gatsby-part-2-of-gatsby-migration","properties":{"title":"Migrating my blog to Gatsby (Part 2 of Gatsby migration)","created":"2017-08-21T00:00:00.000Z"}}}}}
