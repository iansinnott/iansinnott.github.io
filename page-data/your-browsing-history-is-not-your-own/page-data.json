What about 1 year ago? I know I was.</p>\n<p>But you know what? I couldn&#39;t tell you the specifics of what I was doing on the internet. Could you tell me what sites you visited 728 days ago? Probably not.</p>\n<p>This situation I find quite appalling.</p>\n<p>Web browsers record what sites you visit so that you can revisit them in the future, right? Indeed, they do have this functionality. However, after a certain number of <span class=\"italic\">months</span> your history gets deleted.</p>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">Months, </span>that&#39;s right. In the case of Chrome it&#39;s 3 months.</p>\n<p>This is why your browsing history is not true: It&#39;s not a full history.</p>\n<h1>Why should you care?</h1>\n<p>Well, it&#39;s not that you <span class=\"italic\">should</span> care it&#39;s that I <span class=\"italic\">do</span> care. If you have zero curiosity about your past browsing history you can stop reading right nowâ€”the rest of this post probably won&#39;t interest you. </p>\n<p>The reason you might care is that you value having access to your own data.</p>\n<div class=\"callout\"><span class=\"bold\">NOTE</span> This is not a rant about privacy and how your data is being collected and used to sell ads. While also an interesting topic, that&#39;s not the focus of this post. This post is concerned with actually using the data you generate.</div>\n<p>Every time you use a browser you generate <span class=\"italic\">A LOT</span> of data, but for the most part this data isn&#39;t accessible.</p>\n<p>Have you ever wanted to recall something you read online a few months ago? If so, we&#39;re in the same boat. In fact, that little situation is what led me to discover that Chrome only stores 3 months of browsing history! </p>\n<h2>The elephant in the room</h2>\n<p>The obvious objection to this talk of unlimited and persistent browsing history is that you don&#39;t want to record every site you visit. Totally fair. That&#39;s what private browsing is for. Chrome and Firefox literally don&#39;t record<span >*</span> what you do in a private tab, so everything I&#39;m talking about here would not break the guarantees of private browsing.</p>\n<h1>What can you do? </h1>\n<p>As far as I know, not much. There is a <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/history-trends-unlimited/pnmchffiealhkdloeffcdnbgdnedheme\">Chrome Plugin</a> that will store your history in a separate database and thus keep it around for you. That&#39;s a great start, but it has a few shortcomings:</p>\n<ul><li>Chrome only. If you use more than one browser you have incomplete data.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Single-device only. If you use more than one computer you have fragmented data.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Trust. That Plugin requires full access to all your browsing history and you have to trust that the developer is not doing nefarious things with your data.<ul><li>I&#39;m not implying they are, I&#39;m just pointing out that<span class=\"yellow_background\"> having to trust a third party is a weak point of any service that deals with sensitive data</span>. Even if you do trust the developer, their account could become compromised and thereby compromise all your browsing history.</li></ul><ul><li>This problem would be somewhat mitigated if the project was open source, but as far as I can tell the code is not available for review. </li></ul></li></ul>\n<h1>An alternative</h1>\n<p>At long last I decided to take matters into my own hands. I&#39;m building a tool to easily and continuously backup your browsing history while making it easy to search.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking:</p>\n<ul><li>Continuous history backups for Chrome and Firefox so you never lose history.<ul><li>Do many people use any of the other browsers? This is not a dig, I honestly don&#39;t know anyone not using one or both of these. I&#39;m sure the number is <code >&gt; 0</code> but is it significant? ðŸ¤·</li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li>Search / Dashboard UI to give high level stats, a simple search box and of course allow you to run SQL against your history.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Optional cross-device syncing.<ul><li>This would either be through a third-party service (Dropbox probably) or I&#39;d have to create a back-end. Not sure what would make most sense yet. I&#39;m still in the brainstorming phase.</li></ul></li></ul>\n<div class=\"callout\"><span class=\"bold\">NOTE</span> There&#39;s no mention of mobile browsers here because I&#39;m honestly not sure how to pull that data. On iOS for example, could I create an app that simply exfiltrates browsing history? If so, where would I send the data? In this case it seems I&#39;d <span class=\"italic\">definitely</span> need a server and possibly need to add some mobile UI to make Apple allow it through the app store.</div>\n<h1>A broader vision</h1>\n<p>Browsing history is just the tip of the iceberg. I&#39;d also like to instantly be able to search over many things for which ample data exists but is not readily accessible:</p>\n<ul><li>Podcasts I&#39;ve listened to</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Audiobooks I&#39;ve listened to</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Songs I&#39;ve listened to</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Ebooks I&#39;ve read</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Highlights in ebooks I&#39;ve read</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Youtube videos I&#39;ve watched</li></ul>\n<ul><li>etc...</li></ul>\n<p>We&#39;re all generating so much data every day and yet we have very limited access to it. I&#39;d like to change that. </p>\n<p>No more wondering &quot;What was that interesting video I watched earlier this year?&quot; and not being able to find an answer.</p>\n<h1>Interested?</h1>\n<p>If having access to your browsing history sounds at all interesting to you then <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ian_sinn\">message me on Twitter: @ian_sinn</a>. I&#39;d be happy to share.</p>\n","properties":{"tags":null,"created":"2020-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Your Browsing History is not Your Own","disqusId":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"8838f721-2596-5494-ac61-e9a3900be27e","prev":{"id":"98fe281e-46f4-543d-8a86-c94c959157c2","slug":"editor-overload","properties":{"title":"Editor Overload","created":"2020-08-20T00:00:00.000Z"}}}}}
