I just discovered something super cool which is currently letting my host my blog, a <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">GitHub Pages</a> site, using SSL.</p>\n<h2>All the SSL fo&#39; free using CloudFlare</h2>\n<p>It turns out if you use <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/\">CloudFlare</a> for DNS on your domain you can also get SSL completely for free.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"//dropsinn.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen%20Shot%202016-04-29%20at%2012.43.40%20PM.png?table=block&id=\" alt=\"CloudFlare Free Cert\"/><figcaption>CloudFlare Free Cert</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The setup is pretty simple as well. CloudFlare has the excellent feature that they will scan your domain and migrate most of the DNS settings for you. So all I ended up having to do to get blog.iansinnott.com running over HTTPS was to move my DNS to CloudFlare. The DNS propagation took overnight, but the time I had to personally spend was less than 30 minutes.</p>\n<p>Again, this is completely free, which is why I&#39;m happy to write about CloudFlare and give them what amounts to free advertising. I&#39;m guessing they make their money with enterprise clients as opposed to individuals. Either way, I&#39;ve found this to be an excellent free service and I&#39;m happy to now have my GitHub Pages site running over SSL for free.</p>","properties":{"tags":"security","created":"2016-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Going fully HTTPS (SSL) fo' free","disqusId":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"dab21a7f-2a99-544a-b34e-2e1ed6ed99f8","prev":{"id":"56bd99d3-2eb4-59f4-8f96-b18782228f60","slug":"the-importance-of-community","properties":{"title":"The Importance of Community","created":"2016-04-29T00:00:00.000Z"}}}}}
