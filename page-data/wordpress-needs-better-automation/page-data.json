In fact I think I even wrote up a short post about that some time back. Anyway, another thing that&#39;s been on my mind lately is the friction that comes from small tasks that keeps us (or at least me) from completing larger tasks.</p>\n<p>In the case of WordPress, there is far too much friction associated with creating new posts on a regular basis. As a programmer, I have come to despise most interfaces that require me to carry out repetitive tasks myself when they could be easily automated. I&#39;m talking about things like:</p>\n<ul><li>Open browser, head to my site login page</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Ideally I&#39;m already logged in, but more likely I need to login again</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Spend a few seconds remembering my password</li></ul>\n<ul><li>In the WP dashboard, click on New &gt; Post</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Copy and paste the title from the blog post I just finished</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Copy and paste the content as Markdown into the WP editor</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Hit publish</li></ul>\n<p>That&#39;s the basic procedure when it comes to creating a new post, at least for me. The issue is that most of this is really repetitive and shouldn&#39;t require my attention. Ideally I could type a command in Terminal, something like:</p>\n<pre>wp post awesome-blog-post.md</pre>\n<p>Then it would just shoot of to my server and post for me. If I could do this I would write more. I know for a fact that this automation friction is keeping me from posting more on my blog.</p>\n<p>Using a terminal command would mean I could just store my blog&#39;s URL, my username and my password in a local configuration file and everything would work, every time. Another massive time-saver would be not having to wait for page loads as I navigate the WP admin.</p>\n<p>So I&#39;ve concluded <span class=\"bold\">WordPress needs better automation</span>.</p>\n<h2>There are better ways…</h2>\n<p>I&#39;m aware that there are much better platforms for blogging out there, or at least more suitable for a programmer&#39;s workflow (definitely <a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com/\">jekyll</a>, maybe <a href=\"https://ghost.org/\">Ghost</a> as well). In fact I plan to change my blog setup next time I do a site redesign. But that&#39;s a relatively large project to undertake in say, 20 minutes. So I haven&#39;t made the switch yet.</p>\n<h2>An opportunity</h2>\n<p>So in the end I&#39;ve also come to the conclusion that this would be something very useful to build myself. Since I recently started using Ruby this could be a good opportunity to make something useful from scratch with the language. Still, the same reason I haven&#39;t switched blogging platforms hasn&#39;t changed: where does one find the time…?</p>","properties":{"tags":null,"created":"2014-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","title":"WordPress Needs Better Automation","disqusId":"2086620445"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"aaf1f4e4-e6d3-591e-8f10-cea98cfd5036","prev":{"id":"1abc8a2b-66b6-520a-826e-b16a103863dc","slug":"javascript-everywhere","properties":{"title":"JavaScript Everywhere","created":"2013-12-05T00:00:00.000Z"}}}}}
