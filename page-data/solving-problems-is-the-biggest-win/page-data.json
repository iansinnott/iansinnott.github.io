It&#39;s not uncommon during an initial phone screen to be asked some variation of the following ‚Äúsoft‚Äù interview question:</p>\n<blockquote>What are you passionate about?</blockquote>\n<p>or...</p>\n<blockquote>Why do you like software development?</blockquote>\n<p>As simple and possibly over-used as these questions are, they&#39;re still good ones. So am I <span class=\"italic\">really</span> passionate about software development? Hell yes. But that&#39;s not the answer to the underlying question of why‚Äîwhy am I passionate about it?</p>\n<p>It&#39;s this line of thinking that has led me to do some introspection recently, and I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that what it really boils down to is <span class=\"bold\">solving problems</span>.</p>\n<h2>Solving problems is the biggest win</h2>\n<p>When you solve a problem for yourself it feels great. Not only that, but you then have one less problem. The satisfaction of solving problems certainly isn&#39;t exclusive to programming, but programming is one of the best tools to solve an extremely wide array of problems, which is why I love it.</p>\n<p>But as satisfying as solving one&#39;s own problems can be, the biggest win in my mind is to ...</p>\n<h2>Solve other people&#39;s problems</h2>\n<p>This realization really solidified in my mind a number of months ago as I was combing through <a href=\"https://github.com/iansinnott\">my GitHub profile</a> to clean out old repositories I no longer use. It was when I first saw <a href=\"https://github.com/iansinnott/alfred%E2%B8%BBmaestro\">one of my repos</a> getting starred by other people üòÄ.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://dropsinn.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen%20Shot%202015-02-20%20at%202.42.24%20PM.png\" alt=\"Alfred Maestro Repo\"/><figcaption>Alfred Maestro Repo</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span class=\"bold italic\">Other people</span><span class=\"bold\"> were using something I created</span>, and apparently they liked it. The level of satisfaction I got from that project remains very high to this day.</p>\n<p>The best part is, solving other people&#39;s problems is not only valuable but it&#39;s also motivating.</p>\n<h2>Maintaining motivation</h2>\n<p>Alfred Maestro (my most-starred repo) is a project I wrote over a year ago, using my least favorite language (PHP) but I&#39;ve still maintained it and responded to any user issues throughout because <span class=\"italic\">other people were using it</span>. It&#39;s that motivation that has kept that little project going. That motivation is really powerful.</p>\n<p>In this way solving someone&#39;s problem can become a positive feedback loop: The more positive feedback you get about your project and the way it&#39;s solving problems, the more you&#39;re motivated to continue to solve that problem.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s a beautiful thing.</p>","properties":{"tags":"personal","created":"2015-02-20T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Solving problems is the biggest win","disqusId":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"d769ce29-9b56-5e73-8739-a650099fd0e0","prev":{"id":"885c51b7-3ab1-5fd1-a59f-3dda656c663d","slug":"a-new-direction","properties":{"title":"A New Direction","created":"2015-02-16T00:00:00.000Z"}}}}}
