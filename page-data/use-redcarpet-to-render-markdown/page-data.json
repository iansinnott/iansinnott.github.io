I also like to use the excellent <a href=\"http://marked2app.com/\">Marked</a> app to preview my markdown. Unfortunately, even though Marked claims to support <a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/github%E2%B8%BBflavored%E2%B8%BBmarkdown/\">Github Flavored Markdown</a> (GFM) it leaves some features out. I&#39;m not going to blame Marked for the incomplete implementation of GFM, they outsource the processing to <a href=\"https://github.com/Orc/discount\">Discount</a>, so it&#39;s probably not their fault. But certain features of GFM, like nested lists, are really useful so I decided to switch to <a href=\"https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet\">RedCarpet</a>, since that is the Gem GitHub itself uses to parse READMEs.</p>\n<p>So, for anyone else who runs into the issue of Marked&#39;s incomplete GFM support, simply install <code >redcarpet</code> and use it as a custom processor:</p>\n<pre>sudo gem install redcarpet</pre>\n<p>In the &quot;Advanced&quot; section of Marked&#39;s preferences you can find the custom processor section:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://dropsinn.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen_Shot_2015-01-26_at_2_26_54_PM.jpg\" alt=\"Custom Marked Processor\"/><figcaption>Custom Marked Processor</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">Note:</span> You <span class=\"italic\">might</span> have to click the &quot;Update Permissions&quot; button since Marked may not have read access to wherever you&#39;re <code >redcarpet</code> executable is located.</p>\n<p>Once you&#39;ve added the custom processor you should get a little nondescript button near the lower right-hand side of your Marked windows:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://dropsinn.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen_Shot_2015-01-26_at_2_27_38_PM.jpg\" alt=\"Custom processor button in Marked\"/><figcaption>Custom processor button in Marked</figcaption></figure>\n<p>If you click that button you should now get markdown rendered through your custom processor!
