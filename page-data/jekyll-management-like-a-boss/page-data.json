This is what it looks like in the terminal:</p>\n<ul><li>Create a new post: <code >post new [post title]</code></li></ul>\n<ul><li>List all of my posts: <code >post list</code></li></ul>\n<ul><li>Search existing posts: <code >post search [post title]</code></li></ul>\n<ul><li>Edit a post: <code >post edit [partial post title]</code></li></ul>\n<ul><li>Publish to this blog: <code >post publish</code></li></ul>\n<p>I really like <a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a>, but having to manually create files with the Jekyll filename format (<code >YYYY-MM-DD-post-title</code>) is a bit of a hassle. Clearly you could just do this by hand, but if you&#39;re like me and want to automate all the minutia in your life, then that&#39;s not going to cut it.</p>\n<p>The other reason I decided to write a script for managing Jekyll was <span class=\"italic\">friction</span>. Blogging can be fun, but sometimes it&#39;s hard to get myself to actually start writing posts. In the past, that was largely because my post-writing workflow looked something like this:</p>\n<ol><li>Open a new Markdown file</li></ol>\n<ol><li>Write an amazing post</li></ol>\n<ol><li>Open a browser, log in to WordPress</li></ol>\n<ol><li>Use the WordPress UI to create a new post</li></ol>\n<ol><li>Copy my Markdown from my editor into the WordPress WYSIWYG</li></ol>\n<ol><li>Hit publish</li></ol>\n<ol><li>Navigate to the post on the front-end to make sure it looked OK</li></ol>\n<p>Steps 3-7 were really causing a lot of friction when it came to writing blog posts. So much so that I still have some posts sitting on my computer that never got published because interacting with the WordPress UI is just too tedious. Here&#39;s what my new workflow looks like:</p>\n<ol><li>In a terminal: <code >post new Jekyll Management Like a Boss</code></li></ol>\n<ol><li>Write blog post about Jekyll. Save it.</li></ol>\n<ol><li>Back in a terminal: <code >post publish</code></li></ol>\n<p>And done.</p>\n<p>Now I have no excuses. If I don&#39;t write a post, I can only blame my own lassitude since I now have a super efficient workflow. This is a good thing.</p>\n<h2>Why not Octopress</h2>\n<p>The only existing option for managing a Jekyll blog that I came across was <a href=\"http://octopress.org/\">Octopress</a>. It&#39;s a good project, and I already miss some of its features by not using it, but to me it had one glaring problem: Theming. There is limited documentation on how to theme Octopress, and while there are a bunch of 3rd-part Octopress themes to choose from it&#39;s just not good enough. I have nothing against using premade themes, it&#39;s just that once in a while you will probably want to change some little thing about the site and if you don&#39;t know how it&#39;s a real pain.</p>\n<p>The other reason I decided against Octopress, is fairly minor, but significant in my mind: The CLI syntax. If you don&#39;t know, creating a new post in Octopress looks like this:</p>\n<pre>rake new_post[&#39;Post Title&#39;]</pre>\n<p>To me that just doesn&#39;t make sense, when you can just as easily write a script to do the same thing with much less typing:</p>\n<pre>post new Post Title</pre>\n<p>Octopress certainly does <span class=\"italic\">way</span> more than this little script I wrote, and I&#39;m sure those guys knew exactly what they were doing when they designed the CLI the way they did, but it&#39;s the little things like that that really make the experience for me so I just decided to write my own.</p>\n<p>For anyone interested, you can find my script on GitHub: https://github.com/iansinnott/jekyll-post</p>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">Note:</span> I haven&#39;t optimized this script for use on other systems, so it may well not work on Linux or especially Windows. It also won&#39;t work on any system without <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/\"> Node </a> installed.</p>","properties":{"tags":"blog","created":"2014-06-28T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Jekyll Management Like a Boss","disqusId":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"54889f45-1859-513a-959a-8152f6951c95","prev":{"id":"d8d68b45-5669-5b02-b074-b8eace605361","slug":"meteor-is-almost-awesome","properties":{"title":"Meteor is (Almost) Awesome","created":"2014-06-28T00:00:00.000Z"}}}}}
