Why? I&#39;m tired to manual version control, and I enjoy adding new skills to the list of things I&#39;ve learned to become a developer.</p>\n<h2>Becoming a developer is a process</h2>\n<p>No one seems to tell you that there are many great ways to manage your code that don&#39;t involve making tons of backup directories manually in Finder. Well, no one told me anyway. As with many things in the world of development, version control seems to be a simple concept that everyone is already familiar with, so no one talks about it. I&#39;m not complaining, just pointing it out. Putting this mental note down on my blog for later reference.</p>\n<h2>So much to learn</h2>\n<p>I take the time to note this stuff because I want to stay consciously aware of all the seemingly minor things that I learn as I continue to improve my development skills. I was talking to my friend <a href=\"http://nickbudden.com/\">Nick</a> recently about this and he said something along the lines of:</p>\n<blockquote>Welcome to your new life. You will have epiphanies about every three months.</blockquote>\n<p>Becoming a developer means continually learning, and so far I love it.</p>\n<h2>The road traveled so far</h2>\n<p>I think this is a good opportunity to think back on the road I took to get to where I am now. I learned HTML/CSS about two years ago, before taking an long hiatus from web work. When I got back in the game and decided to really learn development my list of necessary skills looked like this:</p>\n<ol><li>HTML/CSS</li></ol>\n<ol><li>PHP</li></ol>\n<ol><li>JavaScript (+jQuery)</li></ol>\n<ol><li>MySQL</li></ol>\n<p>Awesome! I was already 1/4 of the way thereâ€¦ but really I wasn&#39;t. Here&#39;s the one point I would like to make in this post: For better or worse, no one tells you how much you will actually have to learn to be a developer. My actual list of things to learn indeed had those items above, but it also had things like:</p>\n<ul><li>PhotoShop (learn design)</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Text Editor (Dreamweaver is bloated, wanted something new)</li></ul>\n<ul><li>SCSS (or LESS)</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Compass (no more manual prefixing!)</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Setting up Apache locally (I don&#39;t use MAMP)</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Markdown (blogging regularly demands it)</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Version Control (Git)</li></ul>\n<p>There are probably some other things that belong in that last, oh well. However, seeing the extended list does make me happy that no one told me beforehand how much I would really be learning. The task would have been daunting.</p>","properties":{"tags":"tech,web","created":"2013-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Becoming A Developer Is A Process","disqusId":"1279910611"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"8a785659-6f63-52ea-ac2e-d62a6e148076","prev":{"id":"8d897358-33d5-59f6-abc1-19036d9e2b64","slug":"life-upgrades-and-reasons-to-write-more","properties":{"title":"Life Upgrades & Reasons To Write More","created":"2013-04-30T00:00:00.000Z"}}}}}
