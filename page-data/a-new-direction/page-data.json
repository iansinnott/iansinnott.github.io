It&#39;s been an amazing, transformative experience and I&#39;ve had a great time doing it. Entering 2015, I was planning to continue growing my business into the foreseeable future, but after a recent revelation I feel it&#39;s time for a change.</p>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">It&#39;s time to get a </span><span class=\"bold italic\">real</span><span class=\"bold\"> job.</span></p>\n<p>At my last “job” I was my own boss, I worked my own hours, I traveled often and lived however I wanted. So, why then would I choose to give all that up? The answer is simple, it&#39;s because...</p>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">I&#39;m in my comfort zone.</span></p>\n<p>I woke up one morning and realized: <span class=\"bold\">I&#39;ve acclimated.</span> I&#39;m no longer challenged on a daily basis. This was a hard realization to come by, but it&#39;s true. The projects I had been working on might have been fun or interesting but they were ultimately well within my current skill set, which means I had stopped pushing.</p>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">“Never stop pushing.”</span></p>\n<p>I once heard that quote somewhere and it really resonated with me. I never want to stop improving or stop iterating on my own talents. So I&#39;ve decided to join a startup and find something I&#39;m truly passionate about working on. I want to learn and grow at the same time as I provide value to a company I admire.</p>\n<p>There are a number of companies I&#39;m already very passionate about and likely many others I haven&#39;t heard of yet, so...</p>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">The search is on.</span></p>\n<p>For the next few months I&#39;ll be staying in San Francisco learning, improving, meeting new people and looking for the right company. I don&#39;t expect it to be easy, but it will be worthwhile.</p>","properties":{"tags":"personal","created":"2015-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","title":"A New Direction","disqusId":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"885c51b7-3ab1-5fd1-a59f-3dda656c663d","prev":{"id":"8a4cd39f-e946-5238-aa14-fa02ab1e4b26","slug":"express-basics","properties":{"title":"Express Basics","created":"2015-02-02T00:00:00.000Z"}}}}}
