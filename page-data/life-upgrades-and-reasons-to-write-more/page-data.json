A <a href=\"http://nathanmarz.com/blog/you%E2%B8%BBshould%E2%B8%BBblog%E2%B8%BBeven%E2%B8%BBif%E2%B8%BByou%E2%B8%BBhave%E2%B8%BBno%E2%B8%BBreaders.html\">very nice article</a> I read today by <a href=\"http://nathanmarz.com/\">Nathan Marz</a> basically hammered home an idea I already knew to be true: Writing often and eventually writing well can be a key to success.</p>\n<p>So, with that in mind I&#39;m going to start writing more often. Not because I think the world needs to hear what I have to say (yet), and not because I think anyone actually reads my posts, but because it will help me improve.</p>\n<h2>Upgrade</h2>\n<p>This new motivation to write isn&#39;t just due to that article though. Over the past two months I&#39;ve also made several other upgrades to my life style that will make this much easier.</p>\n<h3>New Computer</h3>\n<p>That&#39;s right, brand new Macbook Pro. The ultra sexy retina display means I can finally switch over to using Traditional Chinese as my default language and be able to see all the tiny strokes of characters I need to look up. The massive speed increase means I no longer loath opening Photoshop or more than one browser at a time. Point being, <span class=\"italic\">This is awesome!</span>.</p>\n<h3>New Phone</h3>\n<p>About two years ago I lost my then beloved iPhone 4. Now, after finally deciding to shell out the cash for an unlocked iPhone I&#39;m once again a part of modern smartphone ubiquity. Feels good.</p>\n<p>The point though, is not so much the phone as the great apps I now have access to, namely <a href=\"http://lift.do/\">Lift</a>. This boss of an app is simple, well-designed and made me wakeup without snooze this morning! Only slightly short of a miracle. The app is meant to help anyone achieve any goal simply through tracking. In the future I can see this taking a turn towards notifying all of Facebook/Twitter whenever you fail to meet a daily goal, but for now it is simply an accountability system with other lift users. Even so I can respect the influence this app has already had on me. Just having something to check off the moment I wake up is satisfying enough that I think I&#39;ll keep doing it. Here&#39;s hoping that&#39;s the case.</p>\n<p>The other big one is <a href=\"http://skritter.com/\">Skritter</a>. I&#39;ve been using this Chinese review software for months now but it never really had much of an impact on my studies until I got the new phone. Lately I&#39;ve been using it any moment I don&#39;t have anything better to do. This means on the subway or in the elevator usually. I obliterated my 1300 word study list that had accumulated from lack of use in a week.Cheers to productivity.</p>","properties":{"tags":"chinese,life,tech","created":"2013-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Life Upgrades & Reasons To Write More","disqusId":"1248210906"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"8d897358-33d5-59f6-abc1-19036d9e2b64","prev":{"id":"05bdda9a-c9df-5857-9def-0d925ce31931","slug":"victory-the-realization-of-a-goal","properties":{"title":"Victory!
