As such I asked <a href=\"http://physiquegeek.wordpress.com/\">my buddy Ravi</a> for nutrition advice, and came up with the following daily macros:</p>\n<ul><li>Protein: 180g</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Carbs: 45g</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Fats: 90g</li></ul>\n<p>This is a very minimal diet as it comes out to ~1800 calories. The point being, I would put my body at a caloric deficit every day and lose weight. Simple üòé</p>\n<h3>So much protein</h3>\n<p>Since my normal diet of the past year wouldn&#39;t get me anywhere near 180g of protein in a day I needed to make a change. The simplest way in my mind was to just eat more chicken. Easy enough, I love chicken and know how to cook it. As far as sources of protein go, chicken is amazing. It&#39;s low fat, has zero carbs and of course packs tons of protein. I live near a large chain store called RT-mart (Â§ßÊΩ§Áôº) here in Taipei. At RT-mart raw chicken breast is packaged such that 1kg of chicken meat costs about $6.60. Not bad a bad price, so I this became my main source of chicken.</p>\n<p>I used all that chicken, along with some veggies and kimchi to make dishes like the this:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"/public/images/chicken-one.jpg\" alt=\"Chicken Meal\"/><figcaption>Chicken Meal</figcaption></figure>\n<p>It was going quite well. Meals like that are very low in carbs and fats and super heavy in protein. I continued to make many similar dishes.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"/public/images/chicken-two.jpg\" alt=\"Chicken Meal\"/><figcaption>Chicken Meal</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Then I made another...</p>\n<figure><img src=\"/public/images/chicken-three.jpg\" alt=\"Chicken Meal\"/><figcaption>Chicken Meal</figcaption></figure>\n<p>And another...</p>\n<figure><img src=\"/public/images/chicken-four.jpg\" alt=\"Chicken Meal\"/><figcaption>Chicken Meal</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Sometimes I changed the salad up a bit.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"/public/images/chicken-five.jpg\" alt=\"Chicken Meal\"/><figcaption>Chicken Meal</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The idea behind these meals was great: Eat mostly protein. The problem was, I never took the time to look up the nutrition facts for what I was eating. I knew on a very general level that chicken had a lot of protein, but I didn&#39;t know exactly how much. Remember how I was buying chicken in 1kg packages? I would make a point of eating that entire pack of chicken over the course of a day, so 1000g. In 100g of raw chicken there are about 23g of protein, so I was actually getting about 230g of protein a day <span class=\"italic\">from chicken alone</span>. Then on top of that I was drinking a daily protein shake and eating six eggs for breakfast. Check out this omelet:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"/public/images/breakfast.jpg\" alt=\"Awesome breakfast omelet\"/><figcaption>Awesome breakfast omelet</figcaption></figure>\n<p>So with everything tallied up I was getting about 300g of protein <span class=\"italic\">every single day</span>, well ahead of my goal of 180g. At least I was getting it though.</p>\n<h3>Revising</h3>\n<p>So my takeaway from all this is that you should always be sure to know what your eating before you put it in your mouth. All that extra protein meant that I wasn&#39;t hitting my caloric goals and probably had a caloric surplus most days during the past week. Oh well, lesson learned. From now on I&#39;m going to cut back on the chicken and bring my macros more inline with where they need to be in order to get abs. üçó + üçÉ = üí™</p>","properties":{"tags":null,"created":"2014-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Road to Absterdam Part 1","disqusId":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"7ee2685f-3b1e-5af0-8a4e-92c34d173bd3","prev":{"id":"a47ce774-07eb-56fa-907a-91f9928e0738","slug":"using-docker-on-a-mac-with-boot2docker","properties":{"title":"Using Docker on a Mac with Boot2Docker","created":"2014-09-25T00:00:00.000Z"}}}}}
